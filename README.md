### Hi, I'm Noah a golang and javascript developer living in southeast Florida.
I am a 14 years old going into highschool during the greatest pandemic of the century.

I enjoy reading about programming theory and investigating what makes different programming languages unique. 

- Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
- I'm currently experimenting with data science tools

Some of my favorite personal projects have been :
- [Profitis]("https://github.com/noah427/Profitis) 
A Discord stock market simulator styled game in which servers are "stocks" and their value depends on their member count. ##Most fun developing
- [Emoji Analyzer]("https://github.com/noah427/emoji-analyizer) 
A program that used data from r/emojipasta to determine which emojis should be placed after certain words ##Most fun result
