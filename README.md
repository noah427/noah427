### Hi, I'm Noah a golang and javascript developer living in southeast Florida.
I enjoy reading about programming theory and investigating what makes different programming languages unique. 

- Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
- I'm currently experimenting with data science tools

Some of my favorite personal projects have been :
- [Profitis]("https://github.com/noah427/Profitis) 
A Discord stock market simulator styled game in which servers are "stocks" and their value depends on their member count.
